# My 180-Day Journey from Zero to Data Scientist 🚀 

Welcome to my **180-Day Data Science Journey Repository** 🎯  
This repo documents my **step-by-step learning journey** from Beginner → Expert in Data Science.  

I am following a structured **6-month roadmap** covering:  
✅ Python → ✅ Statistics & Probability → ✅ Data Preprocessing → ✅ SQL → ✅ Machine Learning → ✅ Deep Learning → ✅ Specialization & Capstone Project

This README will **scale for all 26 weeks**.  
For each week, you just need to add a ✅ Completed section (like I did for Week 1 with source code link).
